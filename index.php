	<h2>This is what I'm all about</h2>
	<p>I started making websites for fun way back when I was 15 years old (5 years ago!), and a junior in high school. Since then, I have expanded my web development career from hacking up small scale, table-based webpages to fully functional web applications for friends, clients, and fun.</p>
	<p>Since starting my pseudo-career as a web developer/designer, I have designed countless webpages, developed several small scale web applications, and published a handful of professional sites. Currently I am a Junior at Central College in Pella IA, where I am studying computer science. I have also worked as an intern at Alliance Technologies in Des Moines doing software development.</p>
